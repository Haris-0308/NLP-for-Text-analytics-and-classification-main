Online and Social Media Related Crime,Cyber Bullying  Stalking  Sexting,"This person pinged me on a dating app I was on called Hinge
A text was sent to me asking to ping on the WhatsApp number 
 I was just looking forward to having a normal conversation and nothing more
 I send a message and it was kinda unusual to ask for a video call
 My friend suggested I just give it a try and hang up if I suspect something fishy which I did and accepted the call
I did not show my face first as you can see the screen recording I shared differs from the morphed one
 I hang up after  sec because I was having my doubts
 Then I get these texts to show myself down which was freaking me out so I ignored them
 The opposite person kept calling so I answered once again and I disconnected at  secs of the call as she started to undress in the video
 After a while I receive screenshots and morphed video from a different number trying to blackmail me
 These videos were shared on Facebook with my friends and screenshots of the same were shared with me on Whatsapp
 I am really freaking out because I have never encountered such an incident on the internet before and I am really worried and paranoid
I have blocked these contacts on WhatsApp but they might try to call me again from different numbers
I deactivated my Facebook and deleted my hinge account
 I would request you to please look into it and address the issue at the earliest

Honestly, itâ€™s such a mess, and I donâ€™t even know where to start. Iâ€™ve contacted support, but they keep giving me the runaround. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My social media was frezzing, and then I got locked out of everything. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt this violated before. My privacy is completely shattered, and I canâ€™t do anything to make it stop. Even my tablet isnâ€™t working right anymore. Itâ€™s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email."

I didnâ€™t think much of it until things started going wrong. The next thing I knew, people were calling me asking if I had sent them strange messages, and I hadnâ€™t touched my phone all day. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but it felt like someone was inside my account, doing things while I wasnâ€™t even online. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My bank account was hackd, and then I got locked out of everything. I feel so helpless, like thereâ€™s nothing I can do to fix this.
